CircuitPython Manager helps with deploying projects to CircuitPython devices.

## Features

- Automatically detects CircuitPython device path.
- Backs up the CircuitPython device before deploying to allow recovery.
- Simple command to restore a backup to the CircuitPython device in case something goes wrong.

## Requirements

- Linux. May work elsewhere but not tested.

## Installation

You can install _CircuitPython Manager_ via [pip] from [PyPI]:

```console
$ pip install circman
```

## Quick Start

Connect your CircuitPython device to your computer using USB and wait for the
mount to appear.

Change to the directory of your CircuitPython project. The default is for the
project source code to be in **src/** relative to the project directory.

Then run the deploy.

```console
$ circman deploy
```

A backup of the CircuitPython device will be created and then the project source code will be copied to the CircuitPython device.

If you need to restore the code from before the deploy use the restore command.

```console
$ circman restore
```

To list all available backups:

```console
$ circman list
```

If you made a change directly on the CircuitPython device you can copy it back
to the project source directory. The default destination directory is **src/**.
No backup of the destination is created prior to copying so use with caution.
Ideally the destination directory is under version control to identify changes and
restore if needed.

```console
$ circman sync
```
